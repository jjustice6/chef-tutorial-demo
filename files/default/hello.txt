Hello file generated by Chef. Changes will be overwritten!

Ohai, Chefs!
This is a configuration file that is placed on the client
exactly as it is in the cookbook.
See https://docs.chef.io/resource_cookbook_file.html for more.
Use cookbook_file for things like static files for which
"content" in a normal file resource isn't suitable - for instance,
maybe it is a long and cumbersome file, or perhaps it's a binary
or image format.

However, if a file is going to be changed based on various properties,
a cookbook_file resouce may not be the best solution.
More on that later. ;)
